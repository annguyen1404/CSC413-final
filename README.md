# CSC413 Final Project - Image Captioning

This project aims to recreate the results from the Show, Attend and Tell paper, which describes an model tasked with taking in a vast variety of images representing objects and scenes with multiple attributed captions as input, and generating appropriate captions describing the image. We implemented this model using different hyperparameter values, as well as comparing it to other models using different decoder implementations. The results of each model are evaluated using the accuracy of the generated captions on a test dataset, as well as BLEU score.
